A platform to connect students and businesses to engage with each other. A web application for the industry to support projects or for a student to work on business ideas. In this case, businesses can work on many projects with different requirements, budgets, or unique skill sets. Students will also have the chance to earn first-class real work environment experience. The industry can communicate its project requirements and choose a student team to work on its project, and students can share their work and be open to selling their projects or receiving support.

For this project we chose the MERN stack â€“ Mongo, Express, React, NodeJs. This technology stack is a user-friendly full-stack JavaScript framework that allows us fast development, to build this application in only 13 weeks.
We host our front and back end services, in Netlify and Render respectively. Finally we used Firebase for authentication and file storage functionality.
