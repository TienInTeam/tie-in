A platform to connect students and businesses. This project aims to create a web application that connects students and businesses to collaborate on projects and exchange ideas. The platform will enable businesses to post their project requirements, budget, and skill set required, and students can apply to work on these projects. The students can gain valuable real-world work experience, and businesses can work on multiple projects simultaneously.

To build this application, we have used the MERN stack â€“ Mongo, Express, React, and NodeJS. The MERN stack is a full-stack JavaScript framework that allows for fast development and is user-friendly. The choice of this stack enables us to build the application quickly in just 13 weeks.

We have hosted the front-end and back-end services on Netlify and Render, respectively. Netlify is a hosting service that simplifies the deployment process and offers a range of features such as continuous deployment, form handling, and more. Render is a cloud provider that provides scalable and secure cloud infrastructure for web applications.

To implement authentication and file storage functionality, we have used Firebase. Firebase is a backend as a service (BaaS) platform that provides many features such as authentication, real-time database, cloud storage, and more. We chose Firebase for its ease of use, scalability, and flexibility.

Overall, the MERN stack along with Netlify, Render, and Firebase is a powerful combination that enables us to create a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform to connect students and businesses.
